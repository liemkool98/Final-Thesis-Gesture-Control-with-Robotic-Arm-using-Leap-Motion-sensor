# Final-Thesis-Gesture-Control-with-Robotic-Arm-using-Leap-Motion-sensor
That is my final-year Thesis, mentioned about a new methodology to control Robotic Arm: hand gesture. With supporting of modern and power sensor: Leap Motion, the interaction between human and machine (both in lifestyle and industry) become more friendly and easily

My thesis used an simple 3-axes Robotic and Arduino for control. Joins movements has been supplied by RC servo motors. My control model is Master-Slave, with RF remote communication for master and slave devices. For detail please send email to my address: nguyenthanhliem.tg.98@gmail.com
